# Portfolio



After looking over the first version of my portfolio, I decided I would reap the greatest benefit from re-coding from scratch rather than refactoring the original code.  The technical problems most necessary to solve are:

	-Improved responsiveness particularly with regard to the navbar, and image sizes and positioning. 

	
-Improve the organization of the site to make a clear distinction between coding accomplishments and other projects.

	-Greatly improve the UI/UX.  I would like to make the site look extremely polished, balancing a highly professional presentation of the content with a distinct and striking aesthetic 

	-Most importantly, I need to create professional level content for this portfolio including:
		-high quality resume
		- Links to pinned repos of which I’m most proud.
		- Links to the deployments of the above repos.
		-A more professional bio
		-A professional branding statement.





Solutions:
	-upon a second read of the bootstrap documentation, my understanding of how the cdn’s and the grid system work is greatly clarified.  Using this I was able to achieve fully functional collapsing navbars without resorting to template styling, as well as exact tighter control over the positioning of content elements.
